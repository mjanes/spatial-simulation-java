java-simulation
===============

Intended to be a library and extensions for both gravitational simulations and graphs. Starting with gravitational physics simulation.


Immediate base/graphity physics TODO:
- Introduce camera object for use by the canvas to determine painting.
- Provide better initialization stuff
    - Allow ui to specify number of entities, how spread out from 'center' they are, degree of spin, variation of mass, velocity, etc.
- Provide bounding box to eliminate entities outside of some scope
- Get 3d viewing to work

Wide spectrum architecture TODO:
- Make it work as a social network viewer
- Make it work as alife simulator
    - There are a number of ways we can make it work as an alife simulator. First... is probably just 2d or 3d simple bacterial like sim. If we're going to do movement... well, I'd like to have something of a physics model backing it, not sure how complex that will be.

General TODO:
- Translate to javascript, in different repo
- Potentially translate to Python, in different repo
