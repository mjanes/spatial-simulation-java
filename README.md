spatial-simulation-java
========================

Intended to be a base library for anything from gravitational simulations to games to graph display. Starting with gravitational physics simulation.


Immediate base/graphity physics TODO:
- Provide better initialization functionality
    - Allow user to specify number of entities, how spread out from 'center' they are, degree of spin, variation of mass, velocity, etc.
- Make 3d camera that can rotate view
	- Matrix math, etc.
- Model collisions

Expansion TODO:
- Make it work as a social network viewer, change gravity physics to spring embedded physics
- Make it work as alife simulator
    - There are a number of ways we can make it work as an alife simulator. First... is probably just 2d or 3d simple bacterial like sim.

Broader TODO:
- Translate to javascript, in different repo
- Potentially translate to Python, in different repo
